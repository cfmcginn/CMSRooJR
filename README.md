To build, run 'make'

If on svmit machine, a public build of RooUnfold should already be linked in Makefile at following path:
/afs/cern.ch/work/c/cmcginn/public/Packages/RooUnfold/RooUnfold/


In addition, please do the following:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/afs/cern.ch/work/c/cmcginn/public/Packages/RooUnfold/RooUnfold/

I recommend above be put in your .bashrc file so it is not necessary every session
